**Key insights**: 
- The repository acts as a universal distribution model for standardizing behaviors logic via `skills` folders across various LLM platforms, including Gemini Antigravity.
- It relies on `bun` for execution speed and `ghq` to establish a persistent structure within the `ψ/` learning space.
- The use of `SKILL.md` wrappers allows prompts to be cleanly separated from source code logic, establishing long-term memory.
