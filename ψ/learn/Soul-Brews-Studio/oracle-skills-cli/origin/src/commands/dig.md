Execute the `dig` skill with the provided arguments.

## Instructions

**If you have a Skill tool available**: Use it directly with `skill: "dig"` instead of reading the file manually.

**Otherwise**:
1. Read the skill file at this exact path: `~/.claude/skills/dig/SKILL.md`
2. Follow all instructions in the skill file
3. Pass these arguments to the skill: `$ARGUMENTS`

**IMPORTANT**: Only use the path above. Do NOT search for or use any other file with "dig" in the name.
