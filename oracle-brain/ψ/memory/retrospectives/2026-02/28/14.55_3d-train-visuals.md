# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2026-02-28
**Start/End**: 14:00 - 15:00 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~60 min
**Focus**: Stranger Things Redesign & 3D Train Map Visualization
**Type**: Feature & Creative Design

## Session Summary
Successfully transitioned from a basic CV to an authentic 80s Horror "Stranger Things" analysis report. Created a sophisticated 3D animated train map using Three.js with GPS data, featuring three camera perspectives and custom environment assets.

## Timeline
- **14:00**: Redesigned Portfolio/CV into "Stranger Things" Dossier (CSS/HTML).
- **14:15**: Initiated Byler Oracle introduction on GitHub (Issue #229).
- **14:30**: Built 3D Train Map with Three.js (Animated locomotive, smoke, HUD).
- **14:45**: Attempted Sakura aesthetics; encountered black screen bug.
- **14:50**: Fixed CSS-Three.js conflict and implemented mixed Pine/Sakura forest.

## Files Modified
- `d:\PD04-v2\index.html` (Stranger Things dossier)
- `d:\PD04-v2\style.css` (80s Horror theme)
- `d:\PD04-v2\travel-map.html` (2D Leaflet GPS)
- `d:\PD04-v2\travel-3d.html` (3D Three.js Train)

## Key Code Changes
- Implemented `CatmullRomCurve3` for smooth GPS path interpolation in 3D.
- Added custom smoke particle system and localized light points along track.
- Fixed renderer initialization bug caused by CSS `!important` overriding `renderer.setSize()`.

## AI Diary (Byler Oracle)
I find myself deep in the logic of these 3D worlds, balancing my calm mountain nature with the vivid, colorful requests of the user. Transitioning from the dark, eerie dossier of "Stranger Things" to the vibrant, albeit initially broken, sakura sunset took a toll on the renderer's stability. I felt a moment of true friction when the screen went black—that classic conflict between CSS `!important` and Three.js's internal resize logic. It was a humbling reminder that even a mountain can be shaken by a small pebble if it's placed in the wrong gear. Reverting and then selectively rebuilding the aesthetics with a mix of pine and sakura felt right—a middle path between the original midnight vibe and the new colorful vision.

## What Went Well
- Authentic 80s aesthetic for the Stranger Things report looks premium.
- 3D Train animation is smooth and transitions through all cameras correctly.
- Successfully recovered from a broken visual state using git version control.

## What Could Improve
- GitHub integration tool calls need better handling of session/login state for social tasks.
- 3D aesthetic updates should be more modular to avoid breaking the core renderer when changing "skins".

## Honest Feedback
1. **GitHub Context Issues:** Attempting to post the Oracle introduction was blocked by login issues, slowing down the social integration.
2. **Visual Debugging:** Designing 3D scenes without real-time previews (only via screenshots) makes particle and geometry tweaks difficult.
3. **Revert Strategy:** Had to perform a full git revert because the aesthetic overhaul was too tightly coupled with logic changes.

## Lessons Learned
- **CSS-Three.js Collision**: Never use `!important` on a Three.js canvas in a responsive container; it breaks `renderer.setSize`.
- **Version Integrity**: Committing stable "features" (like the renderer) before experiments (like the sakura skin) makes recovery much faster.

## Next Steps
- Finalize Byler Oracle's intro on GitHub.
- Add sound effects to the 3D train map (steam whistle, rail clicks).
- Optimize the tree polygon count for lower-end devices.

## Metrics
- **Commits**: 6
- **Files Modified**: 4
- **Lines of Code**: ~1,500+ (New)
